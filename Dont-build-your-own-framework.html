        <img src="images/rm-rf-git-cover-640xnew.png">
        <p class="num-sec-p">In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our custom
           design and had smooth animations and interactions.
           I looked at <a href="#">UIkit</a>, but I didn't pick it for two reasons:</p>
    
          <div class="list-num">
            <ul>
              <li>It had its own opinion on design</li>
              <li>It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"</li>
            </ul>
          </div><br>

    <p class="this-lead-me">
      This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit, provide
       just the basic JavaScript functionality,
       allowing you to style and animate as you wish. I didn't find anything. So, naturally,
        I decided to make <a href="#">my own thing.</a>
    </p><br>

    <p class="i-was-developing">I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was working on
       and it was wonderful.
       I was able to make the
       code just right and implement just the features I need. I took some inspiration from UIkit, 
       but stuck to my main idea.</p><br>

    <p>Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided to refactor. 
      But because I was developing that framework and <em>simultaneously using it,</em>
       I had to rework not only the framework, but the website as well. Apart from that, 
       I was trying to make this work for as many use cases as I could.
       What if you use React? What if you don't? What if you use jQuery? What if you don't
        even know JavaScript that much?</p><br>

    <p class="at-the-point">At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without realizing it, 
      I had put myself in a position
       where I wanted to solve problems that don't yet exist and solve them perfectly. But I still believed that in the
        end, it'd be "worth it".</p><br>

    <p>Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one working on that website.
       Since it used my framework, I had to onboard new people with it. This meant that I had to
       write up a README, then documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we still had to clear
        up some stuff in Slack.</p><br>

    <p>Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on the framework in parallel with the
       website to transition in work on the framework during the weekends and early mornings.</p><br>

    <p class="i-carried-on">I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the habit of abandoning projects,
       so I was
       determined to at least boil the framework down to small organized JavaScript snippets
       that you could download via npm. But do I use <a href="#">Custom Elements</a> or even go simpler than 
       that and use just ES6 classes?</p><br>

    <p class="recently">Recently, I started getting more and more into the React ecosystem. Late to the party, I know. 
      I also 
      started noticing more websites <code>&lt;div id="__next"&gt;</code> or <code>__nuxt</code> or 
      <code>___gatsby</code>. So no matter how I build my framework, it wouldn't work with the way most
       people build for the web. Since <em>I</em> want to start using these tools as well, my framework 
       won't work for me either.</p><br>

    <p>Unrelated to this, I had slowly started to pay more attention to my health and well-being. I changed
       my eating and sleeping habits, started to exercise 
      and stretch more, I even started reading books… This made the weekends and early mornings much more packed
       and valuable.</p><br>

    <p class="and-now">And now I'm here. I had made something that nobody really uses, but still
       represents a solid part of our workflow. What do I do? Well, I think I've learned some lessons in the past
        3 years.</p><br>
    
    <h2 class="code-h2">Code Doesn't Matter</h2>
    <p>Unless you're building software for aircraft or medical equipment, nobody really cares about your code,
       and
       neither should you. Especially in web development. At the end of the day, you want a bunch of boxes with
        text
        and images in them. You can have a hellish codebase and still get the job done. A perfect codebase doesn't
         exist. At least not for a very 
      long time, in large projects, or with many people involved. Things will get messy and you should be ready to 
      accept that.</p><br>

    <h2 class="maintenance-h2">Maintenance Is a Burden</h2>
    <p class="lets-say">Let's say you've built something and it works perfectly. That won't last long. Bugs will 
      appear, new people 
      will join and documentation will be needed, features will be requested. Who's going to handle that? If you're
       doing this as a side project,
       are you prepared to be distracted by these things while working? If not, are you prepared to do them in your 
       free time?</p><br>

    <p>Even if people start contributing with pull requests and taking some of that load off of you, you'll still 
      have to review and approve of what's going on.</p>
    <h2 class="third-party-h2">Third-Party Is Fine</h2>
    <p class="if-p">If you find someone else who has done the work for you, use it. There might be things that you don't like,
       but compared to the hidden costs of maintaining something yourself, they won't matter. If that third-party
        code has been out for a long time, chances are that most common bugs and edge cases would have already been
         handled. Doing things yourself
       should be your last resort, because you'll slowly discover the same issues as well and waste time on solved
        problems.</p>
    <h2 class="launch-h2">Launch Early</h2>
    <p class="on-the-off-p">On the off-chance that you really want or have to build 
      something, launch it as soon as you can. As David Heinemeier Hansson said on <a ref="#">episode "Launch Now"
         of the Rework podcast:</a></p><br>

       &gt; &nbsp;If you're not uncomfortable by the time you're launching, <br>

    <p class="i-never-p">I never really launched my side project. It wasn't "ready". At the same time, it became a bigger and 
      bigger dependency in our main projects. That's an issue, because you're building on top of something 
      that isn't validated by other people. If I had shared it, maybe people would have helped out
       and given ideas for improvements. Or, maybe people would have critiqued it and made me question whether
        it's valuable.</p><br>

    <p>And that's what I was most afraid of — that the project isn't valuable. But no matter how much effort you
       put into something, you still can't know for sure if
       it's valuable until other people give their own points of view. That's why it's better to launch as soon as
        possible:</p><br>
    
    
    <div class="last-dash">
      <ul>
        <li>If you've built something valuable, you'll get more like-minded people to help you 
          out with it</li>
        <li>If you've built something pointless, you'll save time and probably learn about new and
           better approaches</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="conclusion-h2">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I will archive my project. These problems have already been solved by many people, many times.
       We all know that <a href="#">every day, a new JavaScript framework is born</a>. This happens because
        people like me think they've got the silver bullet and can solve
       a certain problem once and for all. But that's impossible and delusional. It's like that <a href="#">xkcd 
        comic about standards:</a></p>
    <div class="img-xkcd"><img src="images/standards.png"></div>

    <p class="we-should-p">We should work on solving new problems, not existing ones. If you find an issue with someone else's code,
       report it or directly submit a pull request and fix it. Not just for yourself, but for
       everybody else! Your contributions will be nicely welcomed! Don't create something new with its own set of 
       problems.</p><br>

    <p class="it-impossible-p">It's impossible to build something entirely by yourself. At some point, your "pristine" code will have to
       interact with other people's "messy" code. Sure, you might not use third-party code on your website, but 
       its existence still depends on it. The operating system it runs on is not built by you. The browser that your 
      viewers use to see it is not built by you. The protocols that carry your data across the wire are not designed 
      by you.</p><br>

    <p>You will always depend on other people's work. Embrace that!</p><br>
